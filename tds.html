    Description

    <br>

    Fully synthetic 2-stroke engine oil for two-stroke engines formulated from
    synthetic base fluids and advanced performance additives.

    <br><br>
    Application
    <br>
    Suitable for oil-fuel mix (pre-mix) and oil injection lubrication systems - follow
    manufacturers
    recommendations for oil-fuel ratio.

    <br><br>

    Features
    <br>
    Its high lubricity helps protect the engine from piston scuffing and component wear. It also
    helps control
    engine deposits and exhaust system blocking, while extending engine life without sacrificing
    power. The oil
    contains a synthetic base fluid that reduces visible exhaust smoke, and low ash additives
    that prevent
    pre-ignition. Additionally, the oil is easily miscible with fuel, which ensures a stable and
    homogeneous
    mixture even in cold temperatures.
